DataReaderCSharpClient.sln contains a C# example of how to make calls through MassHunterDataAccess API.  

The data file path that will be opened by the example is currently hardcoded.  You would need to change its path to point to a valid data file on your system.  Once you have done so, compile the program, and run it.  You can pipe the output to a text file for easy viewing.
