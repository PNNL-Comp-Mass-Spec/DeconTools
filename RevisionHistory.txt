DeconTools DeconConsole / AutoProcessor Revision History

Version 1.1.6053; July 28, 2016     mem
	- The Miscellaneous section of the parameter file now has 3 new parameters for specifying runtime limits
		MaxMinutesPerScan,  default   4 minutes
		MaxMinutesPerFrame, default  20 minutes
		MaxHoursPerDataset, default 400 hours		

Version 1.1.5990; May 26, 2016      mem
	- Remove dependency on DeconEngineV2.dll, since the code has been ported from C++ to C# and the results validated to match
		- See the files with namespace DeconTools.Backend.ProcessingTasks.Deconvoluters.HornDeconvolutor.ThrashV1
		- HornDeconvolutor in namespace DeconTools.Backend.ProcessingTasks uses the new C#-based ThrashV1
		- Specifying <DeconvolutionType>ThrashV1</DeconvolutionType> in the DeconTools parameter file will use the new C#-based ThrashV1
	- Note that ThrashDeconvolutorV2 was a previous attempt to port the C++ code to C#, but the results from ThrashDeconvolutorV2 do not match the C++ results
