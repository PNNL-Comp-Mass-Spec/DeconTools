Autoprocessor_1.0.4262		Sept 1, 2011	gslysz
	- Incorporated Anoop's O16O18 program that extracts peak abundances for peaks that might be part of O16O18 labelled peptide 

Autoprocessor_1.0.4259		Aug 30, 2011	gslysz
	- DeconConsole errors do not wait for user to hit enter; now program exits; 

Autoprocessor_1.0.4211		July 13, 2011	gslysz
	- _scans files written after each scan, not at the end
	- _isos file written to more frequently

Autoprocessor_1.0.4210		July 12,2011	gslysz
	- Improved logging. Fixed some glitches with the Autoprocessor GUI

Autoprocessor_1.0.4129		Apr 22, 2011	gslysz
	- UIMF Frames are 0-based instead of 1-based (this is a change in the UIMFLibrary)

Autoprocessor_1.0.4062		Feb 14, 2011	gslysz
	- Peak data exported with MSFeature associations
	- Interference scoring added

Autoprocessor_1.0.3980		Nov 24, 2010	gslysz
	- overhaul how Bruker files are handled. No longer uses DeconEngine. Uses C# code instead.
	- simply select the parent folder that contains the raw data.
	- works with Bruker_9T; Bruker_Solarix (12T); Bruker_15T
Autoprocessor_1.0.3817		June 14, 2010	gslysz
	- incorporates re-written UIMFLibrary.dll

Autoprocessor_1.0.3791		May 19, 2010	gslysz
	- support for Agilent.D files (new generation TOF)
	- UIMF calibration support
	- Fit re-calculation for RAPID is much improved (faster)

Autoprocessor_1.0.3631		Dec 10, 2009	gslysz
	- revamped exporters to export during the processing instead of at very end.  Writing to a temporary .bin no longer needed. 
	- added sqlite exporters for _isos, _scans, and _peaks.  
	- added new parameter (NumPeaksUsedInAbundance) to allow control over how abundance is calculated for a feature. 
	- support for Bruker 9T data
	- support for summing Bruker 9T data 

Autoprocessor_1.0.XXXX		Nov 2, 2009	gslysz
	- added support for mzXML processing
	- added support for ICR2LS processing
	- added 'Original Intensities' info to UIMF _isos result output.  This column reports the unsummed intensities (Anoop's work).

Autoprocessor_1.0.3490		July 22, 2009 	gslysz
	- Added 'Re-fitter', which re-calculates the fit.  This can be used to calculate a THRASH-style fit value for data processed using RAPID. [this first version is very slow]

Autoprocessor_1.0.3480		July 12, 2009 	gslysz
	- Stopped debugging info from being sent to console (this might slow Matt's DMS performance)
	- Added info on processing % to log file (every 15 min will write to log file)
	- Log file is written as the file is processed, instead of at the very end. 
	- Added new column 'Summed_abundance' (currently doesn't work with RAPID since RAPID does not reveal the isotopes in the isotopic profile)
	- Fixed 'cumulative_drift_time';  should be reporting correctly now.

Autoprocessor_1.0.3475		July 7, 2009 	gslysz
	- Fixed an unwanted conversion from Double to Float that was occurring for most file types
	- Added ability to merge multiple runs into a single _isos and _scans file. (Initially made for Julia Laskin's requirements).  

Autoprocessor_1.0.3470		July 2, 2009 	gslysz
	- Added ability to output peak lists for each scan for IMF and RAW files. 

Autoprocessor_1.0.3463		June 25, 2009 	gslysz
	- prevented memory overload by serializing / deserializing result objects to disk. 
	- reduced sig figs in exported result files (_isos, _scans). 
	- added indicator on UI for total number of Features found. 
	- Log files are given name similar to the file that was processed. 
	- log files record version information of dlls. 
	- new file selection UI
