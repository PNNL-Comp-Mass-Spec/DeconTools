<center><h1>BiblioSpec input and output file formats</h1></center>

<blockquote>

<p>
BiblioSpec makes use of several file formats for input and output.
Below are descriptions of these along with links to additional information</p>

<!-- formats for sqlite tables, ms2 as output-->

<a name="ssl"></a>
<h3>BlibBuild .ssl file</h3>

<p>
In most cases libraries are built from database search result files.
For peptide identificatiosn that do not come from one of the supported
database searches, BiblioSpec supports a generic tab-delimited text
file format refered to as ssl (spectrum sequence list).  Here is a
small <a href="egssl.txt">example file</a>.  An ssl file
must begin with this header line<p><pre> 
file	scan	charge	sequence	modifications
</pre>

<p>
Each of the following lines contains information for one spectrum.
The first column contains a full or relative path to a file containing
the spectrum.  The second column has an id for that spectrum,
typically a scan number or index number.  The third column is the
charge state of the spectrum, followed by the peptide sequence.  The
final column contains the same sequence, this time with the addition
of any modifications given as a mass shift (the difference between the
modified and unmodified residue).  For example, 
<pre>TASEFDC[+57.0]SAIO[+16.0]AQDK</pre>

<p>
<i>Known bug:</i> There is currently no way to include the score or
search type from this file.

<a name="lib"></a>
<h3>Library files</h3>

<p>
BiblioSpec library files are in the sqlite3 format.  Each library is a
small database that you can search and manipulate with standard SQL
commands using, for example, the sqlite3 command line tools.
BiblioSpec does not require that you know any SQL, but should you be
interested in using these files outside of the BiblioSpec context, we
give you the schema.

<p>
The libraries consist of these tables: LibInfo, RefSpectra,
SpectrumSourceFiles, ScoreTypes. <i>Coming soon:</i> the complete
schema for each table with a description of each field.

<a name="ms2"></a>
<h3>Library as text (MS2)</h3>

<p>
<a href="BlibToMs2.html">BlibToMs2</a> allows you to view the spectra in
your library in the .ms2 text format.  This format is recongnized by
<a href="http://proteowizard.sourceforge.net">proteowizard's</a> 
msconvert and can be converted into other formats such as .mzXML.  

<p>
In an .ms2 file there are four types of lines.  Lines beginning with
'H' are header lines and contain information about how the data was
collected as well as comments.  They appear at the beginning of the
file.  Lines beginning with 'S' are followed by the scan number and
the precursor m/z.  Lines beginning with 'Z' give the charge state
followed by the mass of the ion at that charge state.  Lines beginning
with 'D' contain information relevant to the preceeding charge state.
BlibToMs2's output will include D-lines with the sequence and modified
sequence.  The file is arranged with these S, Z and D lines for one
spectrum followed by a peak list: a pair of values giving each peaks
m/z and intensity. Here is an example <a href="egms2">file</a></p>

<a name="report"></a>
<h3>Report files</h3>

<p>
<a href="BlibSearch.html">BlibSearch</a> writes results to a tab-delimited
text file refered to as the report file.  The header (lines beginning
with '#') contains details of the search parameters.  Next is a line
naming each of the fields. Subsequent rows summarize one query-library
match. The fields are as follows:
<ul>
<li>
<code>Query</code> The identifier for the query spectrum.

<li>
<code>LibId</code> The number of the library with the match.  The
header lines will list all libraries being searched and assign each a
number referenced in this column.

<li>
<code>LibSpec</code> The identifier for the library spectrum.

<li>
<code>rank</code> The rank of the match for this query spectrum.  By
default, ranks 1-5 are printed.  In case of a tie (two matches with
the same score) both matches will be given the same rank.

<li>
<code>dotp</code> The score given to this match (a dot product).
Ranges from 0 (poor match) to 1 (two identical spectra).

<li>
<code>query-mz</code> The precursor m/z of the query spectrum.

<li>
<code>query-z</code> The charge of the query spectrum.  If there was
more than one in the spectrum file, they will be listed separated by comas.

<li>
<code>lib-mz</code> The precursor m/z of the library spectrum.

<li>
<code>lib-z</code> The charge of the library spectrum.

<li>
<code>copies</code> The number of spectra in the redundant library for
this same sequence and charge state.

<li>
<code>candidates</code> The number of library spectra the query was
compared to.

<li>
<code>sequence</code> The peptide sequence of the library spectrum.

</ul>

<p>

<h3>Parameter files</h3>

<p>
All BibliSpec tools (with the exception of BlibBuild and LibToSqlite3) 
will accept a parameter file in which additional options can be
specified.  See each tool's documentation page for the specific
options allowed.  The file should contain one option per line with the
full option name and value separated by an equals sign (=).  Here is
an <a href="soon.html">example parameter file</a>.
