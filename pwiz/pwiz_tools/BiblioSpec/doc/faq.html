<h3>BiblioSpec Frequently Asked Questions</h3>

<ol>
<li><b>What input file formats does BiblioSpec support?</b>
<p>
BiblioSpec version 1 accepted two file types,  
<a href=fileFormats#ssl>.ssl</a> files containing peptide-spectrum
match information and .ms2 files containing the spectrum information.
With BiblioSpec version 2, many new input file formats have been
added.

<li><b>What is the difference between BiblioSpec versions 1 and 2?</b>
<p>
The two different versions of BiblioSpec store the libraries in a
different file format.  A BiblioSpec v1 library cannot be read by
BiblioSpec v2 and vice versa.  However, there is a conversion tool,
LibToSqlite3, that will convert a v1 library to v2.
</p>

<li><b>How does BlibFilter select the spectrum to keep in the
    filtered library?</b>
<p>
After building a library from database search results, there are
typically several spectra for any particular peptide at some charge
state.  Let's call them replicate spectra.  A filtered library (the
output of BlibFilter) will contain just one spectrum per peptide at
each charge state.  BlibFilter selects the spectrum as follows.  Each
pair of replicate spectra are compared to each other using a dot
product score. For each replicate an average of those scores is
computed and the replicate with the highest average is selected for
inclusion in the filtered library.
</p>

<li><b>Why isn't my peptide in the library?</b>
<p>
BlibBuild filters the search results based on a score specific to that
file type.  If a peptide-spectrum match has a score beyond the
threshold it will not be included in the library.  Use the command
line options to change the threshold.  BlibBuild also excludes a
peptide-spectrum match if the same spectrum matches a different
peptide at the same score.  In this case the spectrum's identity is
ambiguous and it is not a good candidate for the library.  If there are
cases where you have verified the identity of an ambiguous
identification, you can add them to the library by creating a .ssl
file for those spectra with their correct peptide identification.
Note that an ambiguous identification includes one peptide sequence
with different patterns of modification.  It does not include peptides
that differ by a L/I substitution.

</p>

<li><b>Where can I find BiblioSpec publications?</b>
<p>
BiblioSpec was originally described in <a href=bibliospec.pdf>this
article</a>.  There is also a chapter in Current Protocols in
Bioinformatics  
(<a href=http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/18428681>citation</a>)
documenting the use of BiblioSpec version 1.
