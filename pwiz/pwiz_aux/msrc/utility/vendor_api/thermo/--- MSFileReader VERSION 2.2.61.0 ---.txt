The files in this directory assume the following version of MSFileReader:

    2.2.61.0

You can check your version by inspecting the file properties (Details tab) of 
"c:\Program Files (x86)\Thermo\XRawFile2.dll".

If you have an earlier version, you can install a new version here:

    http://sjsupport.thermofinnigan.com/public/detail.asp?id=703

If you have a later version, the side-by-side manifest file (MSFileReader.XRawfile2.SxS.manifest.real)
in this directory must be modified.  That process is described in the file
"--- README --- How to update MSFileReader.txt" in this directory.
