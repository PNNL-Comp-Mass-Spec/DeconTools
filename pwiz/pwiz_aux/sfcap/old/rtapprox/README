rtapprox README FILE
====================

rtapprox is a sub-project of the ProteoWizard tool set the grew out of
Rob Grothe's attempt to estimate the retention time of peptides coming
off of a column with a linear least squares of their amino acid
composition.

There are three executables build by the make/Jamfile. 

    rtapprox :  Reads in a pepxml file and calculates a linear least 
                squares fit of the peptide composition to rt (retention 
                time).

    tabapprox : Roughly the same as rtapprox, but reads in a tab
                delimited file.

    predict : (unfinished) Paritions the rt space and treats each
                partition linearly.

The project is currently moth-balled.
