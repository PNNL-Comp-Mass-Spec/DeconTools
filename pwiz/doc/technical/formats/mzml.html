    <h1>ProteoWizard mzML information</h1>
    <hr/>

    <h2>What is mzML?</h2>
    <p>
        mzML is the new mass spectrometric data format, developed by the Mass Spectrometry
        Standards Working Group of the HUPO Proteomic Standards Initiative (HUPO-PSI). &nbsp;
        mzML version 1.1 was released in June 2009. &nbsp;
    </p>
    <p>
        mzML was the combined effort of research centers and instrument vendors worldwide. &nbsp;
        It was designed to be a replacement for the mzXML and mzData formats.
    </p>
    <p>
        For more information about the status of the mzML format, see the 
        HUPO-PSI <a href="http://www.psidev.info/index.php?q=node/257" target="_blank">
        mzML development page.</a>
    </p>


    <h2>mzML and ProteoWizard</h2>
    <p>
        ProteoWizard provided the reference implementation of the mzML format during the review process.&nbsp;  
    </p>
    <p>
        ProteoWizard includes a standard C++ platform-independent library for reading and writing 
        mzML.&nbsp; In addition, ProteoWizard provides CLI bindings for use from C# .NET applications.&nbsp;
        ProteoWizard also provides a plug-in Reader interface to simplify conversions 
        from vendor proprietary or other open formats to mzML.&nbsp; 
    </p>
    <p>
        ProteoWizard has been released with the permissive Apache v2 license, which allows 
        usage in both commercial and non-commercial projects, in order to encourage adoption
        of the mzML standard.
