<h1>Proteowizard's MzIdentML API</h1>

<p>MzIdentML is a data exchange standard for the analysis of proteomic
data developed by the <a
href="http://www.psidev.info/index.php?q=node/319">Proteomics
Information Group (PSI-PI)</a> intended to encapsulate all important
information about searches done against MS, MS-MS, MSn data. Enough
information is included to repeat the search and examine the results
among <a href="http://www.psidev.info/index.php?q=node/371">other
capabilities</a>.</p>

<p>Proteowizard's offers an mzIdentML API with a complete object
model, stream reading, and writing. For ease of developement, the
style of mzIdentML is the same as that found in the MSData
project. The data is stored in an MzIdentML object and can be read in
using the MzIdentMLFile class.</p>
