	- Updated CloneUIMF to skip the sqlite_sequence table (auto-generated by SQLite)
	- Updated CloneUIMF to attach the source DB to the target DB (instead of attaching the target DB to the source DB)

Version 1.3.4132; April 25, 2011
	- Changed the Entry_ID column in the Log_Entries table to INTEGER PRIMARY KEY
		- Was previously INTEGER PRIMARY KEY AUTOINCREMENT, which results in the creation of table sqlite_sequence

Version 1.3.4128; April 21, 2011
	- Updated DataReader to reference frames using frame_index instead of FrameNum
		- Use set_FrameType() to change the frame type; it will return the number of frames of the given type
		- Then, obtain frame-related data by frame index instead of frame num
	- Cleaned up code in reader
	- Created FrameType enum (and constants):
			MS = 0
            Fragmentation = 1
            Prescan = 2
            Calibration = 3
